# ratingProduct

I have created 4 endpoints.

1. For adding the products. where a shopkeeper or adminof Site will be adding the product to the webstore.
2. For buying the product, Whenever a customer buys some product, his/her id will be stored in the customers array of that product.
3. For rating that product, whenever a person tries to rate some product, our system will check if this person has brought this product or 
   not(by checking in the customer array of that product), if taht person hasn't bought that product, he will not be able to rate that 
   product. Other wise he can give rating to it from 1-5.
4. For showing out product, we will show the details of our product with the avg. rating plus count of each rating.
